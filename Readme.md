# Deck Of Cards

Developer: Juan Bautista Martín Núñez

I develop the code taking into account future possibilities of adding new decks, e.g. Spanish deck.

A factory patter was created in oder to achieve this objective. Concepts like abstraction and 
polymorphism are applied in the statement.

As a summary, a factory patter was created, so in the future a new desk can be introduced with minor changes, or
 no changes, depending on the acceptance criteria.

The main objective of the statement can be seen and run in the Main class, where the shuffled and 
dealOneCard methods are called.

Furthermore, some basic unit testing were created, so the code coverage is now 75% in methods and 78% in lines.
